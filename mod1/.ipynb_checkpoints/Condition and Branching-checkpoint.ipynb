    "A computer program is a set of sequetial instructions we want our computers to perform. To make theses programs useful and correlate with the human world, we need the help of conditions and branching. Here a specific set of instructions get executed when they meet specified conditions. For example, in the real world, we dance when there is music. So the presence of music is a condition; when this is true, people will dance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for our computer programs, we sometimes need to execute specific instructions only when some conditions will be true. If not, then we will perform a different set of instructions. This is known as branching. In this article, we will discuss these two concepts in Python, which makes our Machine Learning and Data Science programs worthwhile.\n",

    "After going through this blog, we will be able to understand the following things:\n",
    "1. What are the various comparison operations in Python?\n",
    "2. What are the conditions in Python?\n",
    "3. What is branching in Python?\n",
    "4. What are logical operations?\n",
    "5. how do we use logical operations to combine the two conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start our journey of covering the basics about the condition and branching with understanding the comparison operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We compare the values or operands in comparison operation and produce a boolean data type in Python. It's similar to what all other programming languages offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a double eual operator to compare the equality of an operand or a value. For example:"
